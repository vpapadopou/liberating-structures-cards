# Liberating Structures Card Deck

A print-at-home card deck for Liberating Structures.

Inspired by Holisticon's card deck it can help you create strings easily or act as a quick reminder of each format.

## Instructions

Please select the appropriate PDF file according to the paper size your printer uses:


[A4 Paper Size](print/print-a4.pdf)

[US Letter Paper Size](print/print-us-letter.pdf)


- Print using a color printer
- Use a pair of scissors to cut carefully across the dashed line
- Glue the front and back sides of the card using a small amount of glue
- Laminate

Use 160gsm paper for best experience. If you can't normal 80gsm paper should work just fine

Normally you should **turn off** any "Fit to Page" option and select "Actual Size" when printing to print the cards in the intended size. If however that does not work for you (maybe part of the card is trimmed), you should be able to select "Fit to Page" and print the cards without problems. They will be a bit smaller, but that should not affect the overall experience.
